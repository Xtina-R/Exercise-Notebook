# Why I'm taking HIST 3907

Primarily I'm taking **HIST 3907** because I've had a class with [Professor Graham](http://carleton.ca/history/people/1631-2/) and it was the only class I've ever encountered in university where independent thought and originality were truly (not just purportedly) encouraged and rewarded.  It was also a class in which I learned the importance of creating alternative formats for housing historical data, formats that can bring the study of the historical record out from under its current shroud of academic redundancy and into the light of day so that non-academics and understand and care about it.  I'm hoping for more of the same in 3907.

In some ways, I am not a fan of social media and computer technology, mostly because I'm skeptical of the motivation behind the creation of a lot of it, and the fact that governments use it to keep tabs on us; I also think that real life is always much more interesting than spending the day on Facebook or a smartphone. On the rare occasions when I can see that these types of technology can actually do something useful (in this case, preserve history; in other cases, embellish my finances [see below]) I find them pretty cool. I don't have any type of background in tech or science, so learning some of these skills is completely new to me, and can be exciting.

Finally, I'm also human and am graduating this year and would like to have some shiny new skills to add to my resume.  I created and ran an online store (using [Shopify](http://www.shopify.ca)) for a year a few years back so am pretty familiar with some of the simpler, boring technical aspects of the stuff we're going to be doing, like how hosting and servers work, how to format a blog, etc., but am really interested learning how to mine data and hopefully, make it in works of art that jolt people into learning something through visualization that they might never have bothered to read about. I'm also contemplating another go at an online business after graduation, as life circumstances and fear of making some legal error forced me to shut down the first one just when it was starting to be successful, and learning more computer skills would be a benefit to that.

In regards to the digital project for this class, I'm considering a project either working with [Sebastian Heath's list of Roman amphitheatres](https://github.com/sfsheath/roman-amphitheaters) (but my knowledge of how to use this data or even understand it is so limited that I don't yet even have a clue how to begin understanding exactly what can be done with his data) or alternatively, the following:

The overall rate of violent crime in Canada has been decreasing over steadily over the last few decades, according to [Statistics Canada](http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/85-002-x/2014001/article/14040-eng.htm?fpv=2693#a1), but this is not at all reflected in the policies of our current Federal government, nor in the mainstream media.  I am therefore considering some sort of project that would compare/juxtapose a visualization of the actual statistal graphs that reveal this historic decrease over time, together with something (perhaps using [Voyant Tools](http://voyant-tools.org/)?) that would depict what conversations are going on in the [media and government dialogues](http://news.nationalpost.com/2011/07/21/crime-rate-down-across-canada/) that deny this reality and would have the public believe the absolute opposite.
