    <h1>Exercise Assessment Document</h1>
    <p>This short webpage is the document which contains all of the links to the exercises I am submitting for assessment. At the time of doing each exercise, I wrote up a Markdown document using dillinger.io to create a record of my progress and results for each exercise. These exercises are listed below in chronological order.</p>
  <p><b>Module 1</b></p>
  <p> I'm submitting this exercise primarily because the only other part of the exercise was to edit the syllabus with our personal information by forking a copy of it and making a pull request, which I've already done. However, figuring out how to use the Github Windows interface with extremely challenging for me; I did not understand that I had to fine the actual github folder on my computer and that adding documents to this would cause it to appear in the interface. Finally understanding this crucial bit of information was a great personal success.</p>

  <p><b>Module 2</b></p>
  <p>Module 2 was probably the most challenging and frustrating for me, and some of the exercises for it were simply far beyond my capabilities, including the ones were we had to work using the command line. I gave them my best shot, but my understanding of them was virtually nil, whereas this exercise, though challenging, was something I was able to do.</p>

  <p><b>Module 3</b></p>
  <p>This exercise was a triumph for me. I had grave misgivings about my ability to figure out what commands to use to replace data for the ones that were not provided in the exercise, and I also figured that <i>something</i> would go wrong, just because it usually has for me in the course of these exercises. Amazingly, the whole thing went like clock-work.</p>

<p><b>Module 4</b></p>
<p>I chose this exercise for assessment because it <i>didn't</i> work out for me. I followed the steps to georectifying a map using MapWarper, but for whatever reason it didn't work and I never got the map to materialize after adding the points. However, I needed to be able to do this for my final project, and the next time around, when I used the program for my final project, I was able to georectify the map of St. John's no problem. For this reason, I think this exercise really shows the progress I've made in learning to use some of these programs.</p>

<p><b>Module 5</b></p>
<p>OK, being honest here. I chose this exercise because it was the only one I've had time to do, as I've been pretty swamped working on my final project in the last couple of weeks, which had to take priority, simply because there are a certain number of hours in the day.</p>
