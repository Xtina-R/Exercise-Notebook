#Module 3 Exercise 2: RegEx

This exercise was for me the easiest of any so far encountered in this course.  It worked like magic! I encountered no errors, no problems, no unexplainable and obnoxious roadblocks like so many of the exercises in the past. It took me far longer even to figure out how to use the GitHub windows interface worked than to do this exercise. It still took probably close to two-three hours in total, but it was not appallingly difficult.  All of the suggested regexs worked for me, and I didn't find it to hard to figure out the ones that we had to do on our own. I now have an (almost) perfectly-formatted CVS file of useable data--yay!--which can be found [here](https://github.com/Xtina-R/Exercise-Notebook/blob/master/cleaned-correspondence.csv). The original location of my CSV is on my desktop in my school folder, along with all the stages of transformations which I saved at every step.
