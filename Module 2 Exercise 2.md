###Module 2 Exercise 3: Outwit Hub and [Suda Online](http://www.stoa.org/sol/)

I had some trouble with this exercise initially, and had to futz around with the software quite a bit.  All in all it probably took me close to a couple of hours to do this exercise. The data spreadsheet with the scraped results can be found [here](https://github.com/Xtina-R/Exercise-Notebook/blob/master/OutWit%20Scraped%20Export.csv).

Maybe I'm missing something, but I can't see any other types of data--beyond the source URL and the translation--included with the .csv export.

Note: in the midst of this exercise, my computer shut down from low battery and apparently caused some major unknown problem with my Github desktop application, which would not load my commits or take new ones and kept giving me an error messages. But I am so proud! With grave misgivings I researched and followed the directions to [debug a git repository](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11910921/reset-local-git-repository) and it worked! So proud.

I did another search with 'potter' in SUDA which I thought might be interesting given our exercise using the Heidelberg, and that data is [here](https://github.com/Xtina-R/Exercise-Notebook/blob/master/Outwit%20potter%20data.csv).
