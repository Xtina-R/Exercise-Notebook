###Module 2 Exercise 3: APIs

Well. This exercise was awful for me. Professor Graham had to do most of it for me, and so at this point I don't really understand most of what he/we did. We didn't get as far as adding new search parameters for my personal interests.  That is what I have just done. The results from that can be found [here](https://github.com/Xtina-R/Exercise-Notebook/blob/master/urlstograb.txt).  The truth is that I have no clue what to do with this data at this point...

I'm also not search that I configured that new search parameters correctly. I had no clue where/what I was supposed to put it, despite reading the first half of the exercise over carefully. In the end I replaced the numbers before the ? (as was specified when doing the search earlier in the exercise) with a search term (railroad) that brought up results in the [canadiana.ca](http://www.canadiana.ca). That probably wasn't what we were supposed to do but the truth is I am just proud that I managed to figure out where/how to open all the programs I installed during last class for this exercise, and which file to open in a Notepad, and whatnot, since we didn' get that far at the time. I did get Gitbash to work for me at home, independently, and I'm proud that I remembered how to navigate through it (cd documents, ls, etc). The issue is just that I don't think I updated the parameters correctly, so am not really clear on what it searchd for, nor do I have a clue what to do with the data now that I have it..
