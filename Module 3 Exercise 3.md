#Module 3 Exercise 3: OpenRefine

I don't have much to say about this exercise.  OpenRefine worked perfectly, and following the directions laid out by Dr. Graham was easy. It is certainly a fast and sensible way of automatically editing out a lot of crap that would otherwise take considerable time to locate and edit by hand.

The CSV of my refined data can be found [here](https://github.com/Xtina-R/Exercise-Notebook/blob/master/OpenRefine%20CSV). The graph created with this information using Palladio is [here](https://github.com/Xtina-R/Exercise-Notebook/blob/master/Palladio%20Graph.svg).  I'm not sure if my options for playing with Palladio were limited because of problems with the data or what, but there didn't seem to be much I could do with it other than graph the links between source and target.  The only thing I noticed off-hand from this was that Ashbel Smith seems to have been the biggest recipient of letters.
