#Module 4 Exercise 8: Georectifying a Map

I was able to successful georectify a map in MapWarper, and do the first half of the exercise no problem.  The Tiles URL to my map is http://warp.worldmap.harvard.edu/maps/tile/4205/z/x/y.png. 

Trying to use it as a layer in Palladio didn't worked out so well.  I've followed the instructions carefully but Palladio doesn't seem to recognize the URL.  I've also wondered if the software is just having some problems today; it won't even show basic coordinates let alone my map. May give it a shot tomorrow if I'm not able to get any help on it today.  Overall a disappointed--I may need this for my project so it's a bit of a bump in the road.
