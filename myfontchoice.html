    <h1>Progress in the Digital Humanities</h1>
    <p>I choose these two fonts to demonstrate the progress I have made in learning to use digital programs for rending historical data. Playfair is a straight-forward, no-nonesense font that is similar to Times New Roman and in my mind is symbolic of the more traditional approach I have always taken to history.  Press+Start+2P is not a particularly attractive font, but is certainly reminiscent of computers and digital typography and therefore symbolizes that transition I have undergone in learning to use digital programs for historical research. In this respect, the two fonts I have chosen may not look great together, but represent well the idea of a transition from more traditional to digital methods of understanding and representing history.</p>
