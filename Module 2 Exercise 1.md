#####[Canadian War Graves Commission](http://www.cwgc.org/)

For my initial search, I simply searched my surname, and Canada, and received 19 results, which can be seen [here](http://www.cwgc.org/find-war-dead.aspx?cpage=1) .
I have uploaded the data spreadsheet via github and it now resides [here](https://github.com/Xtina-R/Exercise-Notebook/blob/master/Casualty%20Search%20CWGC.csv). 

#####[Epigraphic Database Heidelberg](http://edh-www.adw.uni-heidelberg.de/inschrift/suche?hd_nr=&land=&fo_antik=&fo_modern=&literatur)
For the epigraphic search, my Latin is currently escaping me, so I simply searched 'figlin' as the professor recommended, the uploaded data of which can be located [here](https://github.com/Xtina-R/Exercise-Notebook/blob/master/Heidelberg.csv). Next, I searched for potters in Algeria, which is much more interesting if you ask me--apparently potting(?) was quite a thing in Algeria, as it came up with 807 [results](http://edh-www.adw.uni-heidelberg.de/foto/suche?land=dz&sort=land_sort_en).
