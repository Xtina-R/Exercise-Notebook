# Module 5: Typography Exercise

I had attempted to do this exercise several weeks ago, before I started really getting down to work on my final project, which requires a certain level of comfort with navigation Github. At the time, I found it very confusing and did not understand how to make a separate webpage through the gh-pages.  Now, several weeks after learning to navigate Github in order to make my final project, it seems quite simple.

Here is the link to the results of the [typography exercise](http://xtina-r.github.io/Exercise-Notebook/myfontchoice.html).

I don't think that the theory of choosing fonts that go well together is something that comes naturally to me--I don't really get it. All of the pairs I made in the beginning of the exercise using Typeconnection were bad ones that were apparently not compatible. Sometimes I can see when something looks very bad together, or very good, but unless it's a dramatic difference it's not something that jumps out at me.
